Free Use, Non-Rehost, External-Distribution Restricted License (FUN-E)
Version 1.0

These requirements primarily target redistribution and public sharing.
The conditions below are waived solely for private, personal use, provided
that such use remains non-commercial and non-public.

Personal use may extend to a limited, non-public group of people, provided
that no redistribution, public access, mirroring, or further sharing occurs.

Any modifications made under this personal-use waiver must not be made
publicly accessible. Public repositories, public forks, or any publicly
visible version control systems do not qualify as personal use. Storage or
maintenance of such modifications is permitted only in private repositories
or other non-public systems.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use,
study, modify, and distribute the Software, subject to the following conditions:

1. Free Use Requirement
   This Software was developed without compensation. Any use, modification,
   or derivative work based on this Software must be made available free of
   charge. You may not sell, license for a fee, or otherwise commercialize
   this Software or any derivative work.

2. Modification, Partial Reuse, and Submodule Requirements   
   Any modification, reuse, or inclusion of this Software—whether in whole
   or in part—must follow these rules:

     a) Full or Modified Versions
        If you modify the Software, you must do so via a fork of the original
        repository. You may not reupload, mirror, or republish the Software
        or modified versions as a standalone repository, even with
        attribution, unless explicit written permission is granted by the
        original author.

     b) Partial Reuse
        You may reuse limited portions of the Software (such as utility
        functions, small components, reversed functions and their signatures,
        or patterns) within your own codebase, provided that:
          i) No substantial portion of the original source code is copied,
         ii) Clear and visible credit is given to the original author, and
        iii) This license is retained.

     c) Fork-and-Submodule Requirement for Bundled Applications
        This clause applies only when you must modify this Software and
        bundle it as part of another, separate application.

        If your intent is only to bundle or reference this Software without
        modification, you must not include it directly. In such cases, you
        must either comply with Clause #4 or provide users with links or
        instructions to obtain this Software or its code directly from
        the original repository.

        When modification and bundling are both required, you must:
          i) Fork the original repository,
         ii) Apply your modifications within that fork, and
        iii) Include the forked repository strictly as a Git submodule of
             the larger application.

   Note:
   Portions of this Software may themselves be based on or derived from the
   work of others. Maintaining proper attribution and preserving applicable
   licenses is therefore essential and mandatory.

3. No Rehosting or Mirroring
   You may not redistribute the Software by rehosting it, mirroring it, or
   providing it for download from your own infrastructure, repositories,
   or distribution channels.

   A permanent exception may apply only in cases where access to the
   original repository is impossible for a group of users due to
   restrictions beyond their control (such as network blocking, permanent
   proxy requirement, accessibility constraints, or similar barriers).

   Any such redistribution must:
     a) Be limited solely to enabling access for the affected users,
     b) Preserve this license and all attribution notices,
     c) Clearly state that the Software is an unmodified redistribution of
        the original author's work, and
     d) Not present itself as a general alternative, upstream, or
        authoritative source of the Software.


4. Redistribution and Bundling Restrictions
   If you redistribute, repackage, or integrate this Software into another
   project, product, or tool, you must:
     a) Require users to obtain this Software directly from the original
        author's repository, OR
     b) Obtain explicit written permission from the original author before
        bundling this Software with your distribution.

   In all cases, users must not download this Software from you.

5. Attribution
   You must retain this license and clearly attribute the original author in
   any permitted use, partial reuse, or derivative work.

6. MVSI Project Notice
   This Software is part of MVSI, a collaborative open-source effort developed
   in collaboration with the MVSI Revival Project, which is the primary target
   and intended beneficiary of this code.

   Redistribution or repackaging of this Software may require additional
   permission from the MVSI Revival Project, as unauthorized redistribution
   may compete with their public release.

7. No Warranty
   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL
   THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
   FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
   DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
